🧠 Creativity Engine: A Cognitive Compression Architecture

“Creativity is not just expression—it’s compression. It’s how humans do more with less.”
— Steven Kayler (@CognitionArchitect)
🧩 Problem
Modern artificial intelligence relies heavily on massive data sets and brute-force pattern recognition. But human cognition operates with radically less input—yet produces richer, more adaptive insight. Why? Because we compress, abstract, and repurpose information. That missing function—creativity as a compression engine—is the unmodeled component of AGI.

🧠 Core Concept
This project proposes a functional architecture to embed creativity as a transformation layer within artificial cognition.

Creativity = Compression + Abstraction + Output translation
It reduces dataset size by linking disparate inputs through symbolic or sensory patterns (imagery, sound, metaphor)
It allows AI to create novel concepts rather than just replicate prior data
